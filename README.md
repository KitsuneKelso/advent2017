# advent2017
These are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/).

My aim is to write them in a way so that any input for each day should receive the correct solution.
I opted to use Javascript, and more specifically React, to render each days solutions, and serve them with React Styleguide.
Minor adjustments to the input data might be required so that it actually works with Javascript.

## Installation
Simply run `yarn install` or just `yarn` and you should get everything you need.

## Running
This project uses [React Styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org/) to render the components.

To run it locally just start with `yarn dev` and the content will be served to http://localhost:6060/

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
